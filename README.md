A vaguely sized collection of Userscripts I have either written myself or just any Userscript that I use.

A guide on how to use them can be found on https://greasyfork.org/en

More scripts by me can also be found on https://greasyfork.org/en/users/475505-tettedev

# Disclaimer
All the scipts come as is, some scripts might even be broken as I will probably also include older scripts just for the sake of archiving them
